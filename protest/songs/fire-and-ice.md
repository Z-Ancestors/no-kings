**[Verse 1]**
> Just yesterday morning, they came and they took her away</br>
> No knock on the door, just ICE in a black SUV</br>
> They said it was “orders,” but never showed proof or name</br>
> Now her bed is still made, and her child won't play...

**[Chorus]**
> I’ve seen FIRE and I’ve seen ICE</br>
> I’ve seen homes shattered in the dead of night</br>
> I’ve seen days when the law just turned its head</br>
> But I always thought we’d rise and fight instead...

**[Verse 2]**
> Won’t you look in their eyes — these are people, not numbers or files</br>
> They were chasing some hope when they crossed through the dust and the wire</br>
> Now we hold up our signs, and we light up the steps in the dark</br>
> While they hide behind laws, we remember each name in our hearts...

**[Chorus]**
> I’ve seen FIRE and I’ve seen ICE</br>
> I’ve seen the cold steel gates and tear-filled skies</br>
> I’ve seen days when our rights were stripped away</br>
> But I still believe we’ll march back in their place...

**[Bridge]**
> Been walking my mind to a courtroom line,</br>
> Talkin’ ’bout rights they pretend are mine</br>
> Lord knows when the papers lie,</br>
> You learn how to stand or die...

**[Verse 3]**
> Thought I'd see her this morning, but she’s locked in a cage downstate</br>
> A number, a case, and a trial without even a date</br>
> But the fire’s still burning in every hand joined at the gate</br>
> We are FIRE, we are law, and we won’t be late...

**[Final Chorus]**
> We bring FIRE to the ICE</br>
> We bring truth where they weaponize</br>
> We bring hope where they cage and compromise</br>
> And we won’t back down — not one more life...
