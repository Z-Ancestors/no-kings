*(Free Individual Rights Enforcement)*
**A protest parody of “Fire and Rain” by James Taylor**

**[Verse 1]**
Just yesterday morning, they came and they took her away
No knock on the door, just ICE in a black SUV
They said it was “orders,” but never showed proof or name
Now her bed is still made, and her child won't play...

---

**[Chorus]**
I’ve seen FIRE and I’ve seen ICE
I’ve seen homes shattered in the dead of night
I’ve seen days when the law just turned its head
But I always thought we’d rise and fight instead...

---

**[Verse 2]**
Won’t you look in their eyes — these are people, not numbers or files
They were chasing some hope when they crossed through the dust and the wire
Now we hold up our signs, and we light up the steps in the dark
While they hide behind laws, we remember each name in our hearts...

---

**[Chorus]**
I’ve seen FIRE and I’ve seen ICE
I’ve seen the cold steel gates and tear-filled skies
I’ve seen days when our rights were stripped away
But I still believe we’ll march back in their place...

---

**[Bridge]**
Been walking my mind to a courtroom line,
Talkin’ ’bout rights they pretend are mine
Lord knows when the papers lie,
You learn how to stand or die...

---

**[Verse 3]**
Thought I'd see her this morning, but she’s locked in a cage downstate
A number, a case, and a trial without even a date
But the fire’s still burning in every hand joined at the gate
We are FIRE, we are law, and we won’t be late...

---

**[Final Chorus]**
We bring FIRE to the ICE
We bring truth where they weaponize
We bring hope where they cage and compromise
And we won’t back down — not one more life...
